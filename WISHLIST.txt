get goddart back
get peach cutscene back but skippable (like goddart)
DONE	toggle invert camera in pause menu
widescreen (see https://github.com/Reonu/sm64-widescreen/commit/8ca1d81738d96c5a3b78c757d1720cf05afdfa79)
toggle wide 16:9 in the pause menu
add 'option' instead of 'stereo' like in EU version
	maybe add also the japanese language if its not too hard (and also the JRB unique portrait)
	add alos the widescreen option there so you can maybe see the peach intro cutscene in widescreen?
	add also the option to mirror screen (and invert controls) to offer a fresh experience
	so in the end maybe it would be: OPTIONS:
										LANGUAGES
										ENG		FRE		GER		JAP
										SCREEN RATIO		MIRROR SCREEN
										4:3		16:9		REGULAR		MIRRORED
squish the intro logo a bit, but not as much as in the vanilla European version
